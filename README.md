# StopGo

StopGo is a stop-motion animation application. It's goal is to be a
simple and direct way to take a series of photographs, with
onion-skinning, to create stop-motion animation.

StopGo is free and open source.

## Download and Install

Github is where we do development. If you want to download and use StopGo to make movies, get it here:

You are free to use it at home, in the classroom, or anywhere!

## System Requirements

Dependencies:

* Python 2.x
* wxPython or wxGTK
* six

Currently, StopGo works on Linux and, with a little configuration, Windows.

Install [VLC](http://videolan.org) and [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) (**not** libav) before using StopGo.

We are working on Mac support, too!
